You may have noticed that my website hasnâ€™t been updated recently. Due to the GetHub backend update in December, the latest posts are not appearing as expected. I plan to address this issue soon, but in the meantime, Iâ€™ll be adding links directly to the blog repository as a temporary solution. Thank you for your patience!

# About

I am an experienced IT professional with a strong foundation in cybersecurity, technical auditing, and IT support. With hands-on expertise gained through personal labs and platforms like HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and PortSwigger Academy, I am skilled in identifying and mitigating security threats, performing thorough assessments, and enhancing organizational security posture.

My technical journey is fueled by a passion for understanding both offensive and defensive security strategies, paired with a commitment to continuous learning and skill development. I am actively advancing my skills through practical exercises, including HackTheBox Academyâ€™s Penetration Tester Role Path and completing over 30 HackTheBox machines.
